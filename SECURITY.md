## Scope

This skill performs **read-only** operations against AWS and Kubernetes APIs. It does not create, modify, or delete any AWS or Kubernetes resources. All operations are `describe`, `list`, and `get` calls.

The skill runs locally on your machine using your existing AWS credentials. It does not transmit credentials or cluster data to any third-party service beyond the Claude Code runtime and configured MCP servers.

Security updates are applied to the latest release only.
